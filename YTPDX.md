# Yosh's Track Pack DX

Hello, I am very stupid. I do not really use GitHub, but here is the source code for YTPDX v3. I am writing this to let you know that I coded very little of this myself. Much of the code for this mod is taken from OptPack, as well as some other distributions.
Thank you very much to everyone who makes features for Pulsar. The code for Retro Rewind, Insane Kart Wii, and especially OptPack has been helpful in learning how to use Pulsar v2. Despite this, I will also credit myself as I did make some of the tweaks & features in this mod.
Thank you for playing, and if any of this code is of use to you, I am very glad!
